; The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
; What is the largest prime factor of the number 600,851,475,143 ?

;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
; I had a lot of fun with this one. I learned a lot about x64 programming
; e.g. issues using the stack for pushed parameters, though I removed that
; later for simplicity; why I used + 4 in stack frame references with 32-bit,
; stack alignment, etc.; in short, assembly and cpu architecture makes a bit
; more sense now.
;
; I also got a lot of practice in with gdb debugging this and am much quicker.
; I was getting quite frustrated at the end until I realized I had typo'd the
; number I was supposed to be testing the prime factor for.
;
; % time ./problem3
; The largest factor is: 6857.
